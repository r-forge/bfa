Title: Bayesian Factor Analysis
LinkingTo: Rcpp, RcppArmadillo
Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes
Author: Jared Murray
Description: This package provides model fitting for
    several Bayesian factor models including Gaussian,
    ordinal probit, mixed and semiparametric copula factor
    models. Normal, continuous shrinkage and point-mass
    sparsity priors for factor loadings are available.
    Currently only exploratory factor models are
    implemented.
