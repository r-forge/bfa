Description: This package provides model fitting for several Bayesian factor models
    including Gaussian, ordinal probit, mixed and semiparametric copula factor
    models. Normal, continuous shrinkage and point-mass sparsity priors for factor
    loadings are available. Currently only exploratory factor models are
    implemented.
